# Rejectometer
Predicts organ transplant rejection risk using patient and donor data, leveraging machine learning to optimize matching and improve outcomes.


1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Before training the model, ensure the data is prepared properly for machine learning. Here’s how to approach this:
Key Steps:

Feature Selection: Choose the relevant features that might influence transplant rejection. These might include:
    Patient Features: Age, gender, disease (e.g., renal failure), medical history, etc.
    Donor Features: Age, cause of death, organ type, etc.
    Transplant Details: Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., cyclosporine), transplant date.
    Genetic Data (if available, e.g., HLA matching).
    Rejection Data: Previous rejection history (if available), time to rejection, etc.
After researching there will definitely be more.  

Encoding Categorical Variables:
    Categorical variables (e.g., gender, cause of death, organ type, etc.) will need to be encoded into numerical values.  Use techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
    For example:
        Gender: "Male" -> 0, "Female" -> 1
        Cause of Death: "Motorcycle Crash" -> 0, "Stroke" -> 1, etc.

Handling Missing Values:
    Don't forger, you will need to decide how to handle missing data. Some common strategies include imputing missing values (e.g., using the mean, median, or using a more complex imputation technique like KNN imputation).
    Alternatively, if a feature has too many missing values, maybe choose to drop it from the dataset.

Scaling/Normalization:
    Some features (e.g., age, survival time) may need to be scaled so that their range doesn’t dominate other variables. Checke out StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler for this.

   

2. Feature Example with Data

For example, Jane Smith (age 59) with stage 2 renal failure, cyclosporine, and a donor aged 29 who died from a motorcycle crash, the feature set might look something like this:
Feature	Value
Patient_Age	59
Patient_Disease	Stage 2 Renal Failure
Donor_Age	29
Donor_Cause_of_Death	Motorcycle Crash
Donor_Smoker	Yes
Donor_Drinker	Light
Immunosuppressive_Drug	Cyclosporine
Match_Percentage	99%

For categorical features like Disease, Cause_of_Death, Smoker, and Drinker, you would convert them into numerical values using encoding (e.g., Smoker: Yes -> 1, No -> 0).

3. Building the Random Forest Model

Random Forest is a robust model for this type of problem, as it can handle both numerical and categorical features and capture non-linear relationships. It might not be the best model, but i will try multiple models to see what is most accurate.   

First we will need a script to make kinda random patient data.  Look at UNOS to see if you can get any metrics. Store that data as a CSV and update it continually.  
Find out who is putting anonymized relevant patient data to the internet and see if you can build a ETL pipeline to keep updated data coming in.  

Then another python script that will put a single patient and see what their odds are.  

4. Evaluating the Model
You’ll want to evaluate how well the model is performing, which can be done using metrics like:

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures how far off your predictions are from actual outcomes.  see sklearn.
    R² Score: Gives an indication of how well your model is explaining the variance in the rejection time data.  sklearn too?

You may also want to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data (i.e., using the test set or through cross-validation).
5. Improving the Model

Hyperparameter Tuning: You can tune the hyperparameters of your Random Forest model (e.g., number of estimators, max depth, etc.) using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination.
Feature Engineering: You may need to create additional features or refine existing ones based on medical knowledge to improve predictive power.
Addressing Imbalanced Data: If you have an imbalanced dataset (e.g., rejection events are rare), consider using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or adjusting class weights.


6. Deployment

Once you have a well-performing model, you can deploy it using a variety of methods:

    API Deployment: Expose your model via a RESTful API (using Flask, FastAPI, etc.) for real-time predictions.
    Integration with Medical Systems: Integrate the model into clinical workflows for predicting rejection probabilities for new patients.
